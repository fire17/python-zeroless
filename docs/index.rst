Zeroless

This documentation contains notes on some important aspects of developing Zeroless
and an overview of Zeroless' API. For information on how to use ØMQ_ in general,
see the many examples in the excellent ØMQGuide_. It can give a better understanding
of when to use each messaging passing pattern available (i.e. request/reply,
publisher/subscriber, push/pull and pair). Also, more complex use cases, that require
the composition of these patterns, are explained in further details.

Zeroless works with Python 3 (≥ 3.0), and Python 2 (≥ 2.7), with no transformations
or 2to3. Finally, please don't hesitate to report zeroless-specific issues to our
Tracker_ on GitHub.

Zeroless x PyZMQ
================

Differing from PyZMQ_, which tries to stay very close to the C++ implementation,
this project aims to make distributed systems employing ØMQ_ as pythonic as
possible.

Being simpler to use, Zeroless doesn't supports all of the fine aspects and features
of PyZMQ_. However, you can expect to find all the message passing patterns you were
accustomed to (i.e. pair, request/reply, publisher/subscriber, push/pull). Despite
that, the only transport available is TCP, as threads are not as efficient in Python
due to the GIL and IPC is unix-only.
